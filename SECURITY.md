Hi Logan,

I hope this message finds you well. 
I am Andre and I am planning to be working with your repository SuperPoint_With_Yolo. 
I have a question regarding your pytorch model of Suporpoint/MagicPoint.

Did you write the whole thing yourself? If so, great work and continue to strive! 
If not, also great, but would you be so kind to share the source of the code.
I would highly appreciate. 

I am working at Fraunhofer for the Heinrich-Hertz Institute where we strive to find solutions to problems that arise in the world of computer vision. 

We are partially government funded and indeed the current project I am working on, NalamKi, is mainly funded by EU funds. 

Nevertheless, the Code will only be used for NON commercial puroposes, especially for my Master thesis. 

If you have gained any extra valuable information while writing, building this repo and training the model, I would be happy to hear about it. 

Feel free to contact me via my email: 

andre.dueding@hhi.fraunhofer.de

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

André Düding
